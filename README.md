Arbitrage bot is a program that takes advantage of price differences for the same asset across different markets.
 Here's a simple example of how you might implement an arbitrage bot in Python:

import ccxt  # Library for interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges

# Define the exchanges you want to trade on
exchange1 = ccxt.binance()
exchange2 = ccxt.kraken()

# Fetch market data for a specific trading pair
def get_market_data(exchange, symbol):
    try:
        ticker = exchange.fetch_ticker(symbol)
        return ticker
    except ccxt.NetworkError as e:
        print("Network Error:", e)
        return None
    except ccxt.ExchangeError as e:
        print("Exchange Error:", e)
        return None

# Calculate potential profit from arbitrage
def calculate_profit(exchange1_data, exchange2_data):
    if exchange1_data is None or exchange2_data is None:
        return None

    # Get the ask (selling) price from exchange 1 and bid (buying) price from exchange 2
    ask_price_exchange1 = exchange1_data['ask']
    bid_price_exchange2 = exchange2_data['bid']

    # Arbitrage profit = (Bid price on Exchange 2 - Ask price on Exchange 1)
    profit = bid_price_exchange2 - ask_price_exchange1
    return profit

# Main function to run the arbitrage bot
def main():
    symbol = 'BTC/USDT'  # Trading pair to arbitrage
    exchange1_data = get_market_data(exchange1, symbol)
    exchange2_data = get_market_data(exchange2, symbol)

    profit = calculate_profit(exchange1_data, exchange2_data)
    if profit is not None and profit > 0:
        print("Arbitrage opportunity found! Potential profit:", profit)
    else:
        print("No arbitrage opportunity found.")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

We're using the ccxt library, which provides a unified way to interact with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.

We define two exchanges (exchange1 and exchange2) using the ccxt library. In this example, we're using Binance and Kraken as the exchanges, but you can choose any exchanges supported by ccxt.

The get_market_data function fetches the latest market data (ticker) for a given trading pair from the specified exchange. It catches any network or exchange errors that might occur during the data fetching process.

The calculate_profit function takes the market data from two exchanges and calculates the potential profit from arbitrage. It compares the ask price on Exchange 1 with the bid price on Exchange 2 to determine the potential profit.

The main function is where we fetch market data from both exchanges for a specific trading pair and calculate the potential profit. If a profit opportunity is found, it prints the profit; otherwise, it indicates that no arbitrage opportunity exists.

Finally, we run the main function when the script is executed directly.
